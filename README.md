# crudLib

My crucked aproche to add edit delete view data using javascrit and mysql service in api by http serve by node-red. 

# details

This set of javascript is making CRUD operation on data.
Data is comming from API build in node-red to present http interface returning data from mysql.
Then stuff is process on client site. This need to run at http not file:// rules of import export javascript modules style of coding. There is complitly no security. You can hack it in many points. The concept is to have intranet / home base CRUD library.
