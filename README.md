My crucked aproche to add edit delete view data using javascrit and mysql / sqlite service in api by http serve by node-red. Perfect for internal IoT space. Where you need Fast solution to edit or view data in your data base.

# status of project

In early stage. Working but eeee ....



# details

This set of javascript is making CRUD operation on data.
Data is comming from API build in node-red to present http interface returning data from mysql.
Then stuff is process on client site. This need to run at http not file:// rules of import export javascript modules style of coding. There is complitly no security. You can hack it in many points. The concept is to have intranet / home base CRUD library.

Using historical by now jQueryMobile as a touch ok UI

Configurable:

* url api crud - as *http://your.ip.to.node.red:1880/crud*

* url hosting file path - place for uploaded files - as *http://some.ip.addr.es:3000/public/tmp/*

*  real directory path - to save uploaded files is in node-red function as a value

## hosting it

This can be done by using python3. Command in directory of project

```bash
$ python3 -m http.server 8080
```

After this you can enter at your browser *http://localhost:8080/index.html*
